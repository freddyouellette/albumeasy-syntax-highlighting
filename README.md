# AlbumEasy Stamp Collection Syntax Highlighting

Syntax Highlighting for the program ["AlbumEasy"](https://www.thestampweb.com/albumeasy), which is a way to programmatically make page designs for stamp albums. 

I created this because I think editing these files in VSCode is easier and you get more tools to work with.
